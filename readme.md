# Lil' Devils

This is a tiny little game made in three hours for [Trijam 64](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-64). A good third of the time was spent refamiliarizing myself with Godot, as I got a little rusty recently.

## How to Play

- Move around with the arrow keys
- Hold Z and any direction to shoot fireballs
- Take out as many red devils as you can before they chomp you to death
